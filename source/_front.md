SymbioticLab focuses on *network-informed data systems design* that can yield order-of-magnitude performance and efficiency improvements. 
We tailor Big Data and AI applications to coexist with their underlying networks and apply networking principles in designing new data systems.
This boils down to **three** operating regimes: *single-microsecond* latency within a rack, *single-millisecond* latency within a datacenter, and *hundreds-of-milliseconds* latency across the world.
