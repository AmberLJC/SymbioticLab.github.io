[Leap]({% post_path Leap-Accepted-to-Appear-at-ATC-2020 %}), the fastest memory disaggregation system to date, has won a best paper award at this year’s USENIX ATC conference!

This is a happy outcome for [Hasan](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~hasanal/)‘s persistence on this project for more than two years. From coming up with the core idea to executing it well, Hasan has done a fantastic job so far; I expect more great outcomes for his ongoing works.

Leap is open-source and available at [https://github.com/symbioticlab/leap](https://github.com/symbioticlab/leap).
